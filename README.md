## About the Project

This project provides an in-depth analysis of global population trends from 1980 to 2050. Using historical data and future projections, we can gain insights into how population dynamics vary by country, region, and continent, along with their growth rates and density trends.

### Goals

- Explore historical population growth and future projections.
- Visualize trends in population density and growth rates.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and filter data.

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: United Nations Population Division, World Population Review
- **Years Covered**: 1980 - 2050
- **Data Includes**:
  - Country identifiers and codes (ISO-2, ISO-3).
  - Population for various years (1980, 2000, 2010, 2023, 2024, 2030, 2050).
  - Area and land area for population density calculations.
  - Growth rates, net changes, and global population percentage for each country.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** with `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries.
- **Power BI Desktop** for building and viewing the dashboard.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-population-analysis.git
   cd global-population-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Power BI**:
   - Open the `GlobalPopulationDashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.


### Suggested Visualizations

- **Line Charts** for global population trends.
- **Filled Maps** to show population density by country and continent.
- **Bar and Bubble Charts** for growth rate comparisons and country rankings.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations, including:

- **Population Density Map**: A filled map showing population density for each country.
- **Year Slicer**: Allows filtering data by specific years.
- **Country and Continent Analysis**: Compare population trends by region and country.

### Dashboard Features

1. **Slicers**: Year, Country, Continent.
2. **Charts**: Population trends, density maps, growth rate comparisons.
3. **Interactivity**: Filter by various parameters to dynamically view insights.

## Future Work

- Add real-time data updates if available.
- Include advanced machine learning projections for population growth beyond 2050.
- Refine Power BI dashboard for additional demographic variables (e.g., age, urbanization).
